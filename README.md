# Symmetrical TF2 CFG
Generally what this CFG does is the following,
* Improves LOD, textures, memory, etc.. for performance
* Reduces unnoticable quality settings
* Allows the player to be able to change things without ruining the CFG
### Notes
* Tested using Linux only
* Results will vary between systems and configurations
