# Symmetrical TF2 CFG
Generally what this CFG does is the following,
* Improves LOD, textures, memory, etc.. for performance
* Reduces unnoticable quality settings
* Add as a drop in replacement, or copy the autoexec.cfg contents to the bottom of your current autoexec.cfg
### Notes
* Tested using Linux only
* Results will vary between systems and configurations
